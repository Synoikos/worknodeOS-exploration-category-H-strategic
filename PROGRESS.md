---

## 📊 5-PHASE WORKFLOW

- [x] **Phase 1**: Read all source files (get familiar, don't analyze yet) ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Analyze each file individually → `analysis/files/`
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Cross-file synthesis → `analysis/SYNTHESIS.md`
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Research questions → `analysis/CATEGORY_X_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md`
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Final assembly → `analysis/CATEGORY_X_ANALYSIS.md`

**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Analyzing files individually (0/17 completed)

---

## 📁 PHASE 1: FILE READING

List all files in `source-docs/` then read each one.
**Goal**: Familiarize yourself, take brief notes, don't deep-analyze yet.

```bash
ls -1 source-docs/
```

**Files found: 17** - ✅ ALL READ

- [x] Read: `APPLICATION_LAYER.MD` - Event system implementation status discussion
- [x] Read: `CHECK_THIS.MD` - GitHub URL reference (https://github.com/Synoikos/homotopy-nn)
- [x] Read: `ELEVATOR_PITCH.MD` - Security architecture conversation (very large, 500+ lines read)
- [x] Read: `IMPORTANT_GAPS_TO_SOLVE_STILL.MD` - Gap analysis and Wave 4 planning (large file)
- [x] Read: `KALI_LINUX.md` - Pentesting requirements discussion (Ubuntu sufficient, Kali not needed)
- [x] Read: `OmniDaemon_etc.md` - API analysis and deployment patterns (very large, 500+ lines read)
- [x] Read: `OmniDaemon_facets_integration.md` - OmniDaemon vs DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS comparison
- [x] Read: `README.md` - Paths to Explore directory reference
- [x] Read: `TOOLS_TO_EXPLORE.MD` - Development tools recommendations
- [x] Read: `UI_Implementation.md` - Tauri UI security architecture
- [x] Read: `UI_USER_INTERFACE_TECH.MD` - UI security discussion (similar to UI_Implementation.md)
- [x] Read: `WORKNODE_VS_APS.MD` - Worknode security vs APT threats analysis
- [x] Read: `layer_4.md` - Empty file (1 line only)
- [x] Read: `other_future.md` - WorknodeOS safety comparison with Linux
- [x] Read: `rhizomedb_analysis.md` - RhizomeDB architectural analysis and comparison
- [x] Read: `what_else_to_build.md` - Short fragment about building other projects
- [x] Read: `● Excellent question! Security is CRITICAL for the UI layer. Let me give you the definitive answer on the safest● Excellent question! Security is CRITICAL for the UI layer. Let me giv.MD` - Empty file

**Phase 1 Complete**: ✅ All files read, moving to Phase 2

---

## 🔍 PHASE 2: PER-FILE ANALYSIS

For **each file** in `source-docs/`, create a separate analysis file in `analysis/files/`.

### Template for each file analysis:

**File**: `analysis/files/FILENAME_ANALYSIS.md`

**Required sections** (use AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_BOOTSTRAP.md for criteria definitions):

1. Executive Summary (3-5 sentences)
2. Architectural Alignment
3. **Criterion 1**: NASA Compliance (SAFE/REVIEW/BLOCKING)
4. **Criterion 2**: v1.0 vs v2.0 Timing (CRITICAL/ENHANCEMENT/v2.0+)
5. **Criterion 3**: Integration Complexity (score 1-10)
6. **Criterion 4**: Mathematical/Theoretical Rigor (PROVEN/RIGOROUS/EXPLORATORY/SPECULATIVE)
7. **Criterion 5**: Security/Safety (CRITICAL/OPERATIONAL/NEUTRAL)
8. **Criterion 6**: Resource/Cost (ZERO/LOW/MODERATE/HIGH)
9. **Criterion 7**: Production Viability (READY/PROTOTYPE/RESEARCH/LONG-TERM)
10. **Criterion 8**: Esoteric Theory Integration
11. Key Decisions Required
12. Dependencies on Other Files
13. Priority Ranking (P0/P1/P2/P3)

### Checklist (one per file):

- [ ] File 1: `___________` → `analysis/files/FILE1_ANALYSIS.md`
- [ ] File 2: `___________` → `analysis/files/FILE2_ANALYSIS.md`
- [ ] File 3: `___________` → `analysis/files/FILE3_ANALYSIS.md`

(Add more based on file count)

**Strategy**: Do 1-3 files per session, commit after each, resume in next session

**When complete**: Mark Phase 2 above as [x], commit all analyses, move to Phase 3

---

## 🔗 PHASE 3: CROSS-FILE SYNTHESIS

Create `analysis/SYNTHESIS.md` combining insights from all individual analyses.

**Required sections**:

- [ ] Common Themes (patterns in 3+ files)
- [ ] Convergent Recommendations (multiple files → same direction)
- [ ] Contradictions/Conflicts (incompatible proposals)
- [ ] Synergies (how files complement each other)
- [ ] Implementation Readiness (what's ready vs needs work)
- [ ] Research Gaps (what's underspecified)

**When complete**: Mark Phase 3 above as [x], commit synthesis, move to Phase 4

---

## ❓ PHASE 4: RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Create `analysis/CATEGORY_X_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md` (replace X with your category letter).

**Target**: 30-50 questions total

- [ ] Generate 5-10 P0 questions (v1.0 blockers)
- [ ] Generate 10-15 P1 questions (v1.0 enhancements)
- [ ] Generate 10-15 P2 questions (v2.0 roadmap)
- [ ] Generate 5-10 P3 questions (long-term research)

**Format per question** (see README.md for template):
- Question ID (e.g., A-001)
- Priority, Effort, Dependencies, Approach, Outcome, Relevance

**When complete**: Mark Phase 4 above as [x], commit questions, move to Phase 5

---

## 📝 PHASE 5: FINAL ASSEMBLY

Combine everything into `analysis/CATEGORY_X_ANALYSIS.md`.

**Assembly checklist**:

- [ ] Section 1: Executive Summary (synthesize from all file analyses) - 300-500 lines
- [ ] Section 2: Per-Document Analyses (copy from `analysis/files/`) - 100-200 lines each
- [ ] Section 3: Cross-File Synthesis (from `analysis/SYNTHESIS.md`) - 300-500 lines
- [ ] Section 4: Category-Level Criteria Summary - 200-300 lines
- [ ] Section 5: Integration Roadmap (Phase 1-4 breakdown) - 200-300 lines
- [ ] Section 6: Recommendations - 100-200 lines
- [ ] Verify total length: 1,500-2,500 lines
- [ ] Run completion checklist from README.md

**When complete**: Mark Phase 5 above as [x], final commit and push

---

## 💾 COMMIT STRATEGY

**After each phase or every 2-3 files**:

```bash
git add analysis/ PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "Phase [N]: [what you completed]"
git push
```

Examples:
- "Phase 1: Read all 7 files"
- "Phase 2: Analyzed files 1-3"
- "Phase 2: Analyzed files 4-7, phase complete"
- "Phase 3: Cross-file synthesis complete"

---

## 🔄 RESUMING IN NEW SESSION

1. **Pull latest**: `git pull`
2. **Read PROGRESS.md**: See what's done
3. **Check analysis/ directory**: See what files exist
4. **Continue from current phase**: Pick up where you left off
5. **Update checkboxes**: Mark as [x] as you complete items
6. **Commit frequently**: Save progress incrementally
