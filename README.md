# Category H: Strategic & Meta
## Wave 1 Analysis - DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS Exploration Pipeline

**Repository**: Part of 8-category parallel analysis
**Files**: 17 source documents
**Priority**: See AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_BOOTSTRAP.md for context
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## 📋 MISSION

Analyze all 17 documents in `source-docs/` against **8 stringent criteria** and produce:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis Document** (~1,500-2,500 lines)
2. **Research Questions Catalog** (30-50 questions)

---

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION GUIDE

### Step 1: Read Mandatory Context
```bash
cat AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_BOOTSTRAP.md
```

**This file contains**:
- Worknode architecture overview
- NASA Power of Ten constraints
- 8 stringent criteria definitions
- Analysis output format requirements
- Integration complexity scoring guide

### Step 2: List All Source Files
```bash
ls -1 source-docs/
```

### Step 3: Read All Source Documents
```bash
for file in source-docs/*; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  cat "$file"
done
```

### Step 4: Create Analysis Document

Create `analysis/CATEGORY_H_ANALYSIS.md` with this structure:

#### Section 1: Executive Summary (300-500 lines)
- What do these 17 documents collectively propose?
- Core themes across all files
- v1.0 vs v2.0 relevance summary
- Critical findings (BLOCKING/CRITICAL items)

#### Section 2: Per-Document Analysis (100-200 lines per file)
For EACH file in source-docs/:

**File: [filename]**

1. **Executive Summary** (3-5 sentences)
   - What does this document propose?
   - Why does it matter?
   - Core insight?

2. **Architectural Alignment**
   - Fits Worknode abstraction? (Yes/No + reasoning)
   - Impact on capability security? (None/Minor/Major)
   - Impact on consistency model? (None/Minor/Major)

3. **NASA Compliance Status** (Criterion 1)
   - SAFE: No Power of Ten violations
   - REVIEW: May require bounded refactoring
   - BLOCKING: Requires recursion/malloc/unbounded execution

4. **v1.0 vs v2.0 Timing** (Criterion 2)
   - CRITICAL: Blocks Wave 4 RPC (flag immediately!)
   - ENHANCEMENT: Optional v1.0 improvement
   - v2.0+: Future roadmap

5. **Integration Complexity** (Criterion 3)
   - Score: 1-10
   - Justification
   - What needs to change?
   - Multi-phase implementation required?

6. **Mathematical/Theoretical Rigor** (Criterion 4)
   - PROVEN: Published, production use
   - RIGOROUS: Strong theory, needs validation
   - EXPLORATORY: Novel, needs research
   - SPECULATIVE: Interesting, low confidence

7. **Security/Safety Implications** (Criterion 5)
   - SECURITY-CRITICAL: Capability model, auth, Byzantine
   - SAFETY-CRITICAL: Bounded execution, memory safety
   - OPERATIONAL: Monitoring, logging
   - NEUTRAL: No impact

8. **Resource/Cost Impact** (Criterion 6)
   - ZERO-COST: Pure pattern, no overhead
   - LOW-COST: < 1% CPU/memory
   - MODERATE-COST: 1-5% overhead
   - HIGH-COST: > 5% overhead

9. **Production Deployment Viability** (Criterion 7)
   - PRODUCTION-READY: Well-understood
   - PROTOTYPE-READY: 1-3 months validation
   - RESEARCH-PHASE: 6-12 months development
   - LONG-TERM: > 12 months

10. **Esoteric Theory Integration** (Criterion 8)
    - Which existing theories does this relate to?
      - Category theory (functorial transformations)
      - Topos theory (sheaf gluing)
      - HoTT (path equality)
      - Operational semantics
      - Differential privacy
      - Quantum-inspired search
    - Novel combinations possible?
    - Research opportunities?

11. **Key Decisions Required**
    - What choices must the user make?
    - Trade-offs involved?

12. **Dependencies**
    - Which other files does this depend on?
    - What must be implemented first?

13. **Priority Ranking**
    - P0: v1.0 blocking (must do NOW)
    - P1: v1.0 enhancement (should do soon)
    - P2: v2.0 roadmap (plan for later)
    - P3: Speculative research (interesting but low priority)

#### Section 3: Cross-File Synthesis (300-500 lines)
- **Common Themes**: Patterns appearing in 3+ documents
- **Convergent Recommendations**: Multiple docs suggesting same approach
- **Contradictions/Conflicts**: Incompatible proposals that need resolution
- **Synergies**: How different docs complement each other
- **Implementation Readiness**: What's ready vs needs more work
- **Research Gaps**: What's underspecified or unclear

#### Section 4: Category-Level Stringent Criteria Summary (200-300 lines)
For this category as a whole:
- Criterion 1 (NASA): Any BLOCKING items? Summary of compliance impact
- Criterion 2 (Timing): How many v1.0 CRITICAL vs v2.0+ items?
- Criterion 3 (Complexity): Average integration complexity score
- Criterion 4 (Rigor): Distribution of PROVEN/RIGOROUS/EXPLORATORY/SPECULATIVE
- Criterion 5 (Security): Any SECURITY-CRITICAL or SAFETY-CRITICAL items?
- Criterion 6 (Cost): Overall resource impact
- Criterion 7 (Deployment): Production readiness assessment
- Criterion 8 (Theory): Esoteric theory synergy opportunities

#### Section 5: Integration Roadmap (200-300 lines)
- **Phase 1 (Immediate - v1.0)**: P0 items, implementation order
- **Phase 2 (Near-term - v1.0 polish)**: P1 items
- **Phase 3 (v2.0)**: P2 items with dependencies mapped
- **Phase 4 (Long-term)**: P3 research agenda

#### Section 6: Recommendations (100-200 lines)
- **Implement Now**: What should be done immediately for v1.0
- **Defer to v2.0**: What's not urgent
- **Reject**: What doesn't fit the architecture
- **Research Further**: What needs more investigation

**Expected Total**: 1,500-2,500 lines

### Step 5: Generate Research Questions

Create `analysis/CATEGORY_H_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md` with 30-50 questions.

**Format per question**:
```markdown
### Question H-001

**Question**: [Clear, specific research question]

**Priority**: P0 / P1 / P2 / P3

**Category**: Architecture / Implementation / Testing / Deployment / Theory

**Dependencies**: [Other question IDs that must be answered first, or "None"]

**Effort Estimate**: [Hours or days to answer]

**Stringent Criteria**: [Which of 8 criteria this relates to - list numbers]
- Criterion 1 (NASA Compliance)
- Criterion 2 (v1.0 vs v2.0 Timing)
- etc.

**Research Approach**: [Methodology to answer this question]
- Literature review
- Prototyping
- Formal proof
- Empirical testing
- Expert consultation
- etc.

**Expected Outcome**: [What we'll know after answering - concrete deliverable]

**Relevance**: [How this impacts v1.0, v2.0, or research roadmap]
```

**Question Distribution**:
- 5-10 P0 questions (v1.0 blockers)
- 10-15 P1 questions (v1.0 enhancements)
- 10-15 P2 questions (v2.0 roadmap)
- 5-10 P3 questions (long-term research)

**Expected Total**: 30-50 questions
